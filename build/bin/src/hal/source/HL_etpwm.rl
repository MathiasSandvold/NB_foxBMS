N *
N *	* Generally, __predict_false() error condition checks (unless
N *	  you have some _strong_ reason to do otherwise, in which case
N *	  document it), and/or __predict_true() `no-error' condition
N *	  checks, assuming you want to optimize for the no-error case.
N *
N *	* Other than that, if you don't know the likelihood of a test
N *	  succeeding from empirical or other `hard' evidence, don't
N *	  make predictions.
N *
N *	* These are meant to be used in places that are run `a lot'.
N *	  It is wasteful to make predictions in code that is run
N *	  seldomly (e.g. at subsystem initialization time) as the
N *	  basic block reordering that this affects can often generate

N *
N * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
