N *	* Generally, __predict_false() error condition checks (unless
N *	  you have some _strong_ reason to do otherwise, in which case
N *	  document it), and/or __predict_true() `no-error' condition
N *	  checks, assuming you want to optimize for the no-error case.
N *
N *	* Other than that, if you don't know the likelihood of a test
N *	  succeeding from empirical or other `hard' evidence, don't
N *	  make predictions.
N *
N *	* These are meant to be used in places that are run `a lot'.
N *	  It is wasteful to make predictions in code that is run
N *	  seldomly (e.g. at subsystem initialization time) as the
N *	  basic block reordering that this affects can often generate

N *  @defgroup DCC DCC
N *  @brief Dual-Clock Comparator Module
N *
N *  The primary purpose of a DCC module is to measure the frequency of a clock signal using a second
N *  known clock signal as a reference. This capability can be used to ensure the correct frequency range for
N *  several different device clock sources, thereby enhancing the system safety metrics.

N *  @defgroup CRC CRC
N *  @brief Cyclic Redundancy Check Controller Module.
N *  
N *  The CRC controller is a module that is used to perform CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) to verify the
N *  integrity of memory system. A signature representing the contents of the memory is obtained when the
N *  contents of the memory are read into CRC controller. The responsibility of CRC controller is to calculate
N *  the signature for a set of data and then compare the calculated signature value against a pre-determined
N *  good signature value. CRC controller supports two channels to perform CRC calculation on multiple
N *  memories in parallel and can be used on any memory system.

N *  @brief Enhanced QEP Module.
N *  
N *  The enhanced quadrature encoder pulse (eQEP) module is used for direct interface with a linear or rotary
N *  incremental encoder to get position, direction, and speed information from a rotating machine for use in a
N *  high-performance motion and position-control system. This microcontroller implements 2 instances of the
N *  eQEP module.

N *  @brief Ethernet Media Access Controller/Management Data Input/Output.
N *  
N *  The EMAC controls the flow of packet data from the system to the PHY. The MDIO module controls PHY
N *  configuration and status monitoring.
N *
N *  Both the EMAC and the MDIO modules interface to the system core through a custom interface that
N *  allows efficient data transmission and reception. This custom interface is referred to as the EMAC control
N *  module and is considered integral to the EMAC/MDIO peripheral
